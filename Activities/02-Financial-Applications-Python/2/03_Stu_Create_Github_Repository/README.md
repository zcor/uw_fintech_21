# Create a GitHub Repository

In this activity, you’ll get additional practice with creating a repository via the terminal.

## Background

Very often, software developers use Git via the terminal, or the command line. This allows for flexibility and makes it easy to switch between using Git locally and on virtual machines. In this activity, you will use the terminal to make a repository for your ATM application.

## Instructions

1. Create the Repository

    * Create a GitHub repository with a name that describes your ATM application.

    * Initialize your repository with a `README.md` file.

    * Once your repository is created, click the green "Code" button and copy the https clone link.

2. Clone the Repository

    * Open a terminal window and use `cd` commands to navigate to the directory where you would like to save your repository.

    * Use the `git clone` command and the link you copied previously to clone the repository in the location you selected.

3. Add and Edit Files

    * Copy the files for your ATM application into this folder.

    * Edit your `README.md` file so that the headers match the [README template](Template/README_Template.md).

    * Fill in the sections of the `README.md` file with brief descriptions.

4. Stage and Commit Changes

    * Use the `git status` and `git add` commands to review the changes you have made and track your new files.

    * Once you have tracked your files using `git add`, commit these changes with a message using `git commit -m` followed by a short but descriptive summary of what you changed.

5. Push Local Changes to Remote Repository

    * Use the `git push` command to copy your local changes to the GitHub remote repository.

    * Go to your Github repository to see your changes.
