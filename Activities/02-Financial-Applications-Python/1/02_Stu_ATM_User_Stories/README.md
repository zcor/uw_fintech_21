# ATM User Stories

Before writing any code for a new software application, a developer must first understand what that application will be expected to do. In this activity, you will work with a group to analyze a set of user stories in order to plan a Python program that meets user needs.

## Background

A **user story** is a concise description of a software requirement from the perspective of the person who desires that feature. User stories adhere to the following three-part template:

> As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

  * **As a [type of user]**: This part refers to the role or person who requires the new feature.

  * **I want [some goal]**: In this part of the template, you need to express what the user is trying to achieve. This statement should be free of technology implementation details.

  * **so that [some reason]**: This part of the template will help you prioritize features by translating the benefit the user wants to achieve into the bigger picture of the problem solved. If you can't write this part for a specific user, the feature might be omitted from the system.


## Instructions

Read the following user stories for an ATM:

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **input my PIN for identification.**

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **identify whether I’m going to make a deposit or withdrawal.**

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **input the amount of my deposit or withdrawal.**

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **receive cash.**

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **deposit cash and checks.**

  * As a user of an ATM, I: **want to receive my adjusted account balance.**

With your group, discuss how you would implement these features in a Python program. Don't worry about the physical aspects of an ATM, such as receiving and dispensing cash. Focus on the user interaction and the variables you would need to track.
