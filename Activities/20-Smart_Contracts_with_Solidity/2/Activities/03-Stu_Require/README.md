# Using Require to Enforce Contract Terms

## Background

Implementing terms and rules is a common practice in smart contracts. In this activity, you will enforce contact terms using the `require` function as an alternative to the `if` statement.

## Instructions

Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), import the starter file, and perform the following code drills. Once you finish, compile the file to ensure the code works.

1. Instead of the `if` statement, use a `require` statement to validate that the `recipient` address is either the `public_savings` or the `private_savings` address.

2. In the case of an error, show the following message: "This is not your account."

3. Instead of the `if` statement to validate the contract balance, use a `require` statement.

4. In the case of an error, show the following message: "You don't have enough funds!".
