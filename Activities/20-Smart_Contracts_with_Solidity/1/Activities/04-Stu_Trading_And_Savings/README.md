# Trading and Savings Contracts

## Background

You work for a corporate banking firm that is planing to offer investment options in cryptocurrencies for its customers. As a FinTech professional with experience in Solidity programming, your manager asked you to create two prototype smart contracts: One contract for keeping track of trading transactions, and a second contract to help customers to manage their personal savings.

Follow the instructions below to create these contracts.

## Instructions

Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), import the [starter files](Unsolved/), and perform the following code drills. Once you finish, compile the files to ensure the code works.

1. Use the `latest_trade.sol` file to create a contract named `LatestTrade` that contains:

    * A string variable `coin` with the value `XRP` assigned to it.

    * An unsigned integer variable `price`.

    * A boolean variable `is_buy_price`.

2. Add a function named `updateTrade` to the `LatestTrade` contract as follows:

    * Define an in-memory string variable `new_coin` as the first parameter.

    * Define an unsigned integer variable `new_price` as the second parameter.

    * Define a boolean variable `is_buy` as the third parameter.

    * Into the body of the function, set the contract variables `coin`, `price`, and `is_buy_order` to the inputs of the `updateTrade` function. This function will update the contract variables via the `updateTrade` function.

3. Add a public getter function `getTrade` and a public setter function `setTrade` to the `LatestTrade` contract as follows:

    * The `getTrade` function should return the `coin`, `price`, and `is_buy_order` variables of the `LatestTrade` contract.

    * The `setTrade` function should set the `coin`, `price`, and `is_buy_order` variables with the values of the input parameters `new_coin`, `new_price`, and `is_buy`.

4. Modify the `personal_savings.sol` starter file as follows:

    * Define a public function `withdraw` with two input parameters. An unsigned integer `amount` and a payable address `recipient`.

    * In the body of the `withdraw` function, set a return value the result of the `transfer` function on the `recipient` address using the parametrized `amount`.

    * Add a public payable function `deposit`.

    * Add a payable fallback function.
