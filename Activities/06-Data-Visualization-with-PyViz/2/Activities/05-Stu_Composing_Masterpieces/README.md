# Composing Masterpieces

In your role as a data analyst for a video streaming service, you have been asked by your manager to compare and contrast the subscriber data for various international regions over the last several years.

The continued growth of your firm is dependant on the number of subcribers to the service. You manager has asked you to review the rates of growith in subscriber numbers across time to help determine when their marketing dollars are best focused.

Use your knowledge of compose and overlay plots to create visualizations to gather the data requested by your manager.

## Instructions

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/composing_masterpieces.ipynb), and create a Pandas DataFrame from the "subscriber_numbers.csv" file that is located in the Resources folder.

2. Using both a compose plot and and overlay plot, compare the subscriber numbers for each region for the periods "Q1 - 2018", "Q1 - 2019", and "Q1 - 2020".  How does the rate of growth compare across each region over the time periods being analyzed?

3. Using both a compose plot and and overlay plot, compare the time series trends in subscriber numbers for the two largest regions detailed in the dataset, the "United States and Canada" region and the "Europe, Middle East and Africa" region. How does the rate of growth over the time series compare across the two regions?

4. Given the information in these visualizations, toward what region would you recommend that advertising dollars be focused?

### Hint

Composing plots of different kinds can help users visualize differences in data points. Consider composing plots of different kinds to help underscore similarities and differences in trends.

Also, remember to leverage labels so that you can clearly identify the information displayed by each plot. This will help users glean better insights from the visualization.
