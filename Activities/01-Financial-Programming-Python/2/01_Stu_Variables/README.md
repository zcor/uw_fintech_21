# More Practice with Variables

In this activity, you’ll get more practice declaring, printing, and concatenating variables.

As a reminder, **concatenating** variables involves using the `+` operator to join two string variables.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/variables.py) and perform the following tasks:

**Create string variables.**

1. Create a variable called `subject` and assign it a value of `Programmers`.

2. Create a variable called `first_name` and assign a value of `Ada`.

3. Create a variable called `last_name` and assign it a value of a string, `Lovelace`.

4. Create a variable called `full_name` and assign it a value of the combination of `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.

5. Create a variable called `profession` and assign it a value of a string, `Computer Programmer`.

6. Create a variable called `known_for` and assign it a value of a string, `First Computer Programmer`.

7. Create a variable called `first_algorithm` and assign it a value of a string, `Analytical Engine`.

8. Create a variable called `city_location` and assign it a value of a string, `London`.

9. Create a variable called `country_location` and assign it a value of a string, `England`.

10. Create a variable called `nationality` and assign it a value of a string, `British`.

**Create integer variables.**

1. Create a variable called `birth_year` and assign it with an integer of `1815`.

2. Create a variable called `death_year` and assign it with an integer of `1852`.

3. Create a variable called `age_at_passing` and assign it a value of `death_year minus birth_year`.

4. Create a variable called `year_of_publish` and assign it with an integer of `1842`.

**Print the variables.**

1. Print `First Name: ` and `first_name`.

2. Print `Last Name: ` and `last_name`.

3. Print `Profession: ` and `profession`.

4. Print `BirthYear: ` and `birth_year`.

**Concatenate and print variables.**

1. Create and print a variable, `statement_one`, by assigning it a value of a concatenated string: `Programmers: Ada Lovelace is a British Computer Programmer born in 1815.`

2. Create and print a variable, `statement_two`, by assigning it a value of a concatenated string: `She is commonly referred to as the First Computer Programmer.`

3. Create and print a variable, `statement_three`, by assigning it a value of a concatenated string: `In 1842 she published the first Algorithm, the Analytical Engine, at the age of 27.`

4. Create and print a variable, `statement_four`, by assigning it a value of a concatenated string: `She was a British Citizen who lived in London, England until her passing in 1852 at the age of 37.`
